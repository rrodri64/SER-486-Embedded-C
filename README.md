# SER 486 - Embedded C Final Project
This course focused on C language core concepts, embedded tool chain, and embedded design patterns and programming techniques. The final project was a cumulation of previous assignments, all leading up to creating an IIoT sensor endpoint. Students 
worked with a Linux VM to develop and test embedded C programs on a Raspberry Pi. This specific project focused on establishing communications using a RESTful interface, measuring readings (such as temperature), and rudimentary error logging capabilities. 
Ethernet networking functions that were added include: dynamic address allocation through DHCP, network time sync via SNTP, and 
serving HTTP requests.
